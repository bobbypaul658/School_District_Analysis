Analysis
 The point of the challenge was to help Maria and the school district determine the overall effect of the dishonesty in math and reading subject. There were different grade levels that the student’s study and different districts that Maria wanted to compare her results. 
The district was affected because we were able to determine the math and reading subject. The average math score was 78.9. The average reading score throughout was 81.9. The average passing math score was 74.8. The average passing reading was 85.7. We also compared school scores with others. 
When we replaced the level of the ninth graders it affected the score of the subjects from Thomas High School because now it helped improve the students’ scores for them to be more successful. The average math and reading score are now at 83. When we replaced the 9th grader scores with NaNs it showed the average of the other schools and grades be able to increase if there is NaNs factor in with other scores.  The budged did not affect ninth grade school. The scores of the school can be affected by the size because the sum of all the students will go up or down.  
The four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs. The first changes would be that one the average math score was 79.  Second the average score now is 82.  Now by doing this we determined 75% of students passed math. Four would be that 85.7% students passed reading. We updated the scores for Thomas High students.
